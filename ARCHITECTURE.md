## K8s Cluster Health Checker and Auto-Healing

### üìã Overview

The K8s Cluster Health Checker follows a microservices architecture deployed within the Kubernetes cluster itself. The system consists of three main services that work together to monitor, heal, and alert on cluster health issues.

### üéØ Architecture Principles

1. **Microservices Design**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Cloud-Native**: Designed to run natively in Kubernetes
3. **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable components
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and metrics
5. **Security**: RBAC and secure communication
6. **Resilience**: Self-healing and fault-tolerant design

### üîß Core Components

#### 1. Health Monitor Service

- Prometheus client for metrics collection
- Custom health check plugins

**Deployment**:
- Deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment with 2-3 replicas
- Uses ServiceAccount with cluster-wide read permissions
- Configurable via ConfigMaps and Secrets

#### 2. Auto-Healing Service
**Purpose**: Executes automated remediation actions based on health issues

**Responsibilities**:
- Restart failed or unresponsive pods
- Reschedule workloads from unhealthy nodes
- Clean up orphaned resources
- Trigger scaling operations (HPA/VPA)
- Execute custom healing scripts
- Perform node maintenance operations

**Technologies**:
- Python 3.8+ with event-driven architecture
- Kubernetes Python client for resource management
- Custom action plugins for extensibility
- Queue-based action processing

**Deployment**:
- Deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment with leader election
- Uses ServiceAccount with cluster-wide write permissions
- Configurable healing policies via ConfigMaps

#### 3. Alert Service
**Purpose**: Manages alerting and notifications for critical events

**Responsibilities**:
- Process health check results and trigger alerts
- Route notifications to appropriate channels
- Manage alert escalation policies
- Generate health reports and summaries
- Track alert acknowledgments and resolutions

**Technologies**:
- Python 3.8+ with webhook integrations
- Slack/Teams API clients
- SMTP client for email notifications
- Template engine for alert formatting

**Deployment**:
- Deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment with 2 replicas
- Uses ServiceAccount with read permissions
- External service integrations via Secrets
